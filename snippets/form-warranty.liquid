  Thanks! Your Warranty Claim has been received.

  After the form is submitted, The first step we take to address this is call you or email you to troubleshoot the issue. Many a times we get customers who inform us of an issue, but after troubleshooting, they find out that either they didn't place the battery correctly, or did not press the button hard enough, or sometimes it just starts working after a hard reset. If it is determined by our team that the product indeed has an issue, we will make arrangement to get it picked up at the earliest possible time, and when it arrives back at the warehouse, we will troubleshoot it again.  
  
  If upon physical inspection and check, we determined the product was indeed faulty/defective/malfunctioning, we will accept the return and file it as a WARRANTY CLAIM. Thereafter, it will lead to one of the 3 options:
  
  1. If we found the issue to be minor and we are able to fix it, we will fix it and ship it back to you at NO COST.
  
  2. If we found no issue upon testing at warehouse, we will have to ship it back to you after collecting Rs599 re-shipping fees.
  
  3. If we found a major issue, and it appears it cannot be fixed by us, we will file a warranty claim on your behalf with the manufacturer/brand. After we get the approval for replacement which usually takes 2-3 business days, we will proceed with ringing up a replacement order for exact product and ship you a replacement in exchange for the defective product you returned. This entire process from time it arrives to our warehouse, till when we can ship the replacement (if we have in stock) usually takes 10-14 business days.
  
  Warranty Claim Notes:
  
  *The Replacement product may come in standard bulk packaging which could be a poly bag or white box. This is how the manufacturers usually replace under a warranty claim.
  
  **We are UNABLE TO EXCHANGE IT FOR ANOTHER PRODUCT OR OFFER A REFUND. The only option offered in case of a qualified 15 days warranty claim is a FREE REPLACEMENT.">
