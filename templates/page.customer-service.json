This is NO Brainer!! We gave the world 'KamaSutra' and then several generations later we just decided to walk back in the corner and pull the curtains close. When did our traditions and morality take our right to choices and liberty. Well..It did happen then but now the Young, Bold India is ready to catch up. Its been waiting at the sidelines for a very long time, and now the boys and girls, men and women have come together and said ENOUGH.<\/p><p>Besharam stands for rising up, speaking out and carving your own path.

I have a zest for life, enjoy my time at work and outside of it I am never found at one place. Being a nurse is my dream because I believe in caring for the vulnerable and needy. I have also many talents and skills, I speak 5 languages and almost got a job at FBI as a translator. But then Besharam happened. I love to travel, have been in most cities in America and Europe, but haven't made it to India yet. I hope someday soon when the time is right and when my Indian fellas would connect Besharam for happiness like Cadbury is to chocolate.<\/p><p>I love cooking and can also make delicious Indian meals like Nihari, Butter Chicken and Chicken Tandoori as well. Everyday morning I wake up to Chai and then coffee keeps me going for the rest of the day.

We ship them to you via world class shipping carriers in a non descriptive package & take care of all duties, customs and taxes through till delivery to your door. We are in the business of bringing your curiosity, imagination, desires and fantasies right to your bedroom.<\/p><h4>Why Besharam<\/h4><p>Because Besharam is being bold, being real and being yourself. We believe we all are Besharam, whether we like to accept it is another story. We seldom talk about things that we see, sense, hear, feel and want to experience. Besharam gives you a window to choose what you always wanted to try. Because if you have the means you can achieve true satisfaction, healthier minds and stronger relationships, you will be more happier and less aggressive, more balanced and less impulsive. Because the times we live in needs a medium to provide a way of release, so people are more civil, our precious ones more safe. Because we want to educate people about sex, give them tools to enjoy it in their privacy and comfort and lastly because India is ready, It has been ready for many generations, now it has a voice, a window, a trusted brand and a real community - Welcome fellow Besharam, to our world where fantasy meets reality.<\/p><h4>How It Began<\/h4><p>It began over a cup of coffee and a conversation about how us Indians have aced every aspects of life, science, business, politics and spiritual beliefs and ancient knowhow in health and wellbeing..but still have no real access to experience a lifestyle that we desire in our relationships and private moments. The coffee got cold but the idea caught steam and right that weekend we flew in to California and met with another friend who had great experience in online business structuring. The idea became a concept, the concept became a brand, the brand became a business and the business now needed a face. The following week, we Â met with Sunny Leone, contracted her to be the face of the brand and went back to the airport realising we have planted the seed of Besharam. After over 12 months of research, 5 trips to India, meeting with attorneys and consultants, getting reintroduced to our culture and lifestyle, enjoying dosa's in the morning at Juhu and lunch in South Bombay & dinner in Ghatkopar, we relived our childhood and at the same time build the structure of imbesharam.com brick by brick.<\/p><h4>What NowÂ <\/h4><p>Rome wasn't built in a day, neither would your trust be. So now we start our day by coming to work, have our coffee, talk to our team, listen to you-our customers and run the business in the most systematic, organized and ethical manner, while keeping an eye on the prize. Your trust and faith, for many many years to come.<\/p>",

We all strive to provide you the best service, here is a quick overview:<br\/><br\/>1.When your order clears customs and gets connected with the domestic shipper, they send you an SMS, and our team sends a courtesy SMS\/phone call to all Self Pick up orders to remind them to pick up order soon it arrives.<br\/><br\/>2.After the order arrives at the courier office in the customers pincode, the courier personnel generally makes a call attempt and a delivery attempt on the same day.<br\/><br\/>3.On the third day, if the order is still not delivered or picked up, our team sends a courtesy SMS\/phone call to remind you to pick up the order as the courier office will send it back after 5days.<br\/><br\/>However, in spite of these precautions, few orders sometimes don't get picked up, or get returned back to our India warehouse due to a multiple number of unique reasons. Under these circumstances, if we have to reship the order to you, it will incur a Reshipping Fee of Rs.999, which is charged by the shipper to reattempt the delivery once again. This may also cause a 7-10 business days delay which may vary depending on the time it takes for the package to come back and then for it to get connected in the same cycle once again.<br\/><br\/>So to avoid these circumstances we request you to keep track of your order and also let us know<a href=\"mailto:%20hello@imbesharam.com\">via email<\/a>about your inability to collect or receive the order.<\/p>"
