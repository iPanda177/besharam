Please read the policy in details:<\/strong><\/p><p>In very rare cases, if the product you received has a defect, or it stops functioning within 15 days of receipt, please accept our apologies for this inconvenience if this may happen to you. This should rarely be the case as we work with brands that are reputed for good quality & reliability and pre-packaging inspections in place. We will have to deep dive into it to figure out the issue. Just package it back as you got it and submit the return request form (see below) immediately, more importantly within 15 days of receipt of the package.<\/p><p>The first step we take to address this is call you or email you to troubleshoot the issue. Many a times we get customers who inform us of an issue, but after troubleshooting, they find out that either they didn't place the battery correctly, or did not press the button hard enough, or sometimes it just starts working after a hard reset. If it is determined by our team that the product indeed has an issue, we will make arrangement to get it picked up at the earliest possible time, and when it arrives back at the warehouse, we will troubleshoot it again. <\/p><p>If upon physical inspection and check, we determined the product was indeed faulty\/defective\/malfunctioning, we will accept the return and file it as a WARRANTY CLAIM. Thereafter, it will lead to one of the 3 options:<\/p><p>1. If we found the issue to be minor and <strong>we are able to fix it<\/strong>, we will fix it and ship it back to you at NO COST. This would include fixing\/repairing or replacing parts of the product, which were found to be not working, for example: a cap, remote, bullet or similar parts. <\/p><p>2. If we found <strong>no issue<\/strong> upon testing at warehouse, we will have to ship it back to you after collecting Rs999 re-shipping fees.<\/p><p>3. If we <strong>found a major issue<\/strong>, and it appears it cannot be fixed by us, we will file a warranty claim on your behalf with the manufacturer\/brand. After we get the approval for replacement which usually takes 2-3 business days, we will proceed with ringing up a replacement order for exact product and ship you a replacement in exchange for the defective product you returned. This entire process from time it arrives to our warehouse, till when we can ship the replacement (if we have in stock) usually takes 10-14 business days.<\/p><p>Warranty Claim Notes:<\/p><p>*The Replacement product may come in standard bulk packaging which could be a poly bag or white box. This is how the manufacturers usually replace under a warranty claim.<\/p><p>**We are UNABLE TO EXCHANGE IT FOR <strong>ANOTHER PRODUCT OR OFFER A REFUND<\/strong>. The only option offered in case of a qualified 15 days warranty claim is a FREE REPLACEMENT.<\/p><p><strong>SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES - Warranty Claim AFTER 15 days.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Most brands we stock offer 3 months to 12 months warranty, but any claim made after 15 days, has to be filed with the manufacturer\/brand directly on their official website.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>IMbesharam.com does not claim to offer the manufacturers warranty and expressly states that any Warranty Claims post 15 days of delivery will have to be handled directly by the manufacturer\/brand.<\/strong><\/p><p>In exceptional rare circumstances, if the product you purchased on IMbesharam.com is found to have a defect or stops functioning like it did earlier, after 15 days of delivery, we recommend you file a warranty claim directly with the brand\/manufacturer on their official website by showing the purchase receipt (which is the order confirmation email )you get after making a purchase on our website. In most cases the manufacturer will assist you with warranty replacement. In such cases, you will have to bear the costs of international shipping, imports costs such as duties taxes and any associated fees.<\/p><p>If you would like to engage our services to file the warranty claim and file a replacement request on your behalf, we will be happy to do that at no extra cost. We will however have to collect the cost of shipping and importing a replacement unit, which usually comes to about 60-70% of the value you paid for that original product. After collecting these fees, and upon collecting the defective unit, we will file the claim on your behalf, work with the manufacturer to issue a replacement (if all warranty conditions are met) and then engage our shipping company and our brokers to ship from manufacturer warehouse and pay for import duties, taxes, GST and fees as well as brokerage charges to allow this import into India. The whole warranty cycle will take about 14-21 days from time you make the payment for warranty replacement and we receive the defective product from you.<\/p><p>In such cases, please continue to submit your warranty request using the same 'Warranty Request' claim form below and a manager will be in touch with you via email to discuss the options and process thereafter.<\/p><p><\/p>"
