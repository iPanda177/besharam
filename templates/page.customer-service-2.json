We all strive to provide you the best service, here is a quick overview:<br\/><br\/>1.When your order clears customs and gets connected with the domestic shipper, they send you an SMS, and our team sends a courtesy SMS\/phone call to all Self Pick up orders to remind them to pick up order soon it arrives.<br\/><br\/>2.After the order arrives at the courier office in the customers pincode, the courier personnel generally makes a call attempt and a delivery attempt on the same day.<br\/><br\/>3.On the third day, if the order is still not delivered or picked up, our team sends a courtesy SMS\/phone call to remind you to pick up the order as the courier office will send it back after 5days.<br\/><br\/>However, in spite of these precautions, few orders sometimes don't get picked up, or get returned back to our India warehouse due to a multiple number of unique reasons. Under these circumstances, if we have to reship the order to you, it will incur a Reshipping Fee of Rs.999, which is charged by the shipper to reattempt the delivery once again. This may also cause a 7-10 business days delay which may vary depending on the time it takes for the package to come back and then for it to get connected in the same cycle once again.<br\/><br\/>So to avoid these circumstances we request you to keep track of your order and also let us know<a href=\"mailto:%20hello@imbesharam.com\">via email<\/a>about your inability to collect or receive the order.<\/p>"

            "title": "IS IT LEGAL TO SHOP FOR SEX TOYS ON IMBESHARAM.COM?",
            "text": "<p>The simple answer is YES.<\/p><p>Because we have already done the hard work of importing them through customs by filling all the documents to support the legality of these products, only after they get imported are we able to sell them in India. Our Custom consultants work with the department to properly classify these products and ensure we have the rights and permission to sell and distribute them in India.<\/p><p>Now there is a lot that goes behind the scene, which we will not bore you with. First, we avoid to label them as 'sex toys'.Â These are pleasure products, and we prefer not to label them as 'sex toys' due to the stigma and undue attention it gets.<\/p><p>Legal Explanation: Under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Section 292 prohibits the sale of obscene objects. We argue with the department that these products are NOT OBSCENE and they are being used by an individual in the privacy of their own space, so the Indian Constitution grants each Indian citizen the freedom to their own space and rights to their privacy.<\/p><p>We take full responsibility for the products we sell, so you, the customer does not have to worry about it after having placed the order online. We export our products from the US, import them ourselves in India, pay import duties & taxes and clear customs, and bring your package to your door. So yes, it is LEGAL to shop for products on IMBesharam.com and use them in the privacy of your bedrooms.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SHboHXOBuiE\">Click here<\/a>Â for the videoÂ explanation.<\/p>"

            "title": "WHY IS THE PRICE OF SEX TOYS HIGHER IN INDIA THAN OTHER SITES IN USA & UK\/EUROPE?",
            "text": "<p>The reason is theÂ <strong>complex import process & expensive duties & brokerage charges<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The landed price of an adult product in India is about 3 to 4 times the cost of the product in USA, UK or Europe; the reason are detailed below:<\/p><ul><li><strong>International shipping<\/strong>Â - Usually we ship our consignment through DHL & Fedex from the US to India. The international shipping costs are high with these couriers, and more so lately due to COVID where flights are less, demand is more and rates of all man and material have gone up.<\/li><li><strong>Customs duties<\/strong>Â - The total import duties we pay on our shipments usually range between 105-125% of the declared value (some of the highest in the World) and these includes customs duties, IGST, taxes and various other fees that are collected by Govt. of India for allowing to import this product category. These have gone up from being 70-80% to 105-125% in last 2 years because the government is discouraging international imports and trying to persuade Indian citizens to buy products Made in India, to advance the MakeinIndia agenda.<\/li><li><strong>Broker charges<\/strong>Â - These are fees paid to a specialized group of agents and consultants, who handle all the necessary paperwork, certifications, licensing and regulatory compliances to make these imports happen. If not for them, it is near to impossible to import XX products in India due to the complexities of how rules and laws are written and implemented by authorities. These costs usually form a big chunk of the overall price (generally Â¼ of the cost of the product you pay). The biggest advantage is that when we import through them, our customers identity is NEVER revealed at port of import and your privacy is maintained throughout the entire process.<\/li><li><strong>Domestic shipping and admin fees<\/strong>Â - Thereafter we incur costs of delivering the order to your door, which includes domestic courier shipping, quality control and courier coordination along with operational costs like warehousing & discreet packaging, business operations & customer service, which along with the cost of the product total up to about Â¼ of the total price of the product.<\/li><\/ul><p>For example, if the price of a product costs $100 in the US, by time it reaches India, it will add up:<\/p><ol><li>US cost of product, shipping & admin costs = $120<\/li><li>International shipping = $50-$75<\/li><li>Customs duties = $120-$150<\/li><li>Broker charges = $95-$125<\/li><li>Domestic shipping and admin fees = $20-$30<\/li><\/ol><p>Total Landed costs in India = $405-$500<\/p><p>The sum total of these costs end up making the product 3-4x the price you can buy it in the USA, UK or Europe where there are NO such complex import processes or import restrictions that end up raising the selling prices.<\/p><p>We are aware that some international online shops may claim they âship worldwideâ including India, but we do not recommend purchasing from any sites unless they clearly GUARANTEE 100% complete custom clearance and door delivery to you. We have seen and heard many customers take this risk, had their orders confiscated at Customs in India and ended up receiving show-cause notices from the department asking to show up to explain why they imported a âprohibitedâ obscene product in India. The sellers, under these circumstances, will fold hands and will be unable to assist with clearance or refunds, since they claim they have already shipped the consignment and they are relieved of their responsibilities.<\/p><p>For such reasons, adult products in India will be a specialized commodity until the import restrictions are relaxed or we manufacture them in India, in which case we run a risk of producing products that may not match internationally reputed brand standards until such Indian manufacturing and skill sets become trained and competent to match up International standards of quality, hygiene and packaging.<\/p>"

Before we address and share the alternate payment options, we want to make sure of a few things that you have already checked-<br\/>1. That your card is a DEBIT or CREDIT CARD with a VISA\/MASTERCARD\/AMERICAN EXPRESS logo on it.<br\/>2. That your card has an expiration date and that it has NOT expired yet<br\/>3. That your card has a CVV code in the back (three digits for VISA\/MASTER) and 4 digits in the front for AMERICAN EXPRESS<br\/>4. That you have available credit \/funds in your account to make that purchase<br\/>5. And lastly if you have a CARD that says INTERNATIONAL , use that FIRST. However if all above fails, you can make a payment using NETBANKING (<a href=\"http:\/\/in.imbesharam.com\/pages\/net-banking-instructions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Netbanking Payment Instructions\">instructions here<\/a>) or by purchasing a E-Giftcard fromÂ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giftcardsindia.in\/products\/i-m-besharam-gift-voucher\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Giftcards India website\">GiftCardsIndia<\/a>Â and using that to pay for your order on our store.
